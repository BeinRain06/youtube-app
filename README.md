## Description : \* challenge issue

**1. error failed code 429**

> i got that error in my <App/> component when fectching external API data coming from the web APi: **dictionary api dev**. The real issue given by this error according to this code **429** is :**Too many requests**. It was due to the fact that in the code underneath :

`const fetchDictionnaryWord = async () => {
    try {
      setLoading(true);
      const response = await axios.get(
      `https://api.dictionaryapi.dev/api/v2/entries/en/${word}`
);

**-->** console.log ("dico data:", response.data);

      const results = await response.data;

**-->** setDataWord(results);

      setTimeout(() => {
        setLoading(false);
      }, 500);
    } catch (err) {
      console.log(err);
    }

};`

> **what was going on**

- I was calling the two lines above marked by arrow(**-->**) at the same time . I have to call one at the time. Either `console.log ("dico data:", response.data);` or `setDataWord(results);` but not the both at the same time;

**2. error cannot update a component while rendering another component**

> initially i want to set a **useState Hook** to count everytime i click the **Search icon** and **re-render the dom** after doing that . But i **break** some rules of **react** not according to change state in a **child component** while this state has been firslty declared in a **parent component**. Here have a pattern look over my mistake:
>
> 1. first doing in **<App/>** i declared ` const [count, setCount] = useState(0);`
> 2. i passed **count** and **setCount** to a child of <App/> component

- `<SearchBar
  count={count}
  setCount={setCount}
/>`
  > 2. i end set up **count** with an onClick event in my button
- `<button
  className="btn_wrapper d-flex flex-center"
  onClick={**setCount(count + 1 )**}
  >
      <i className="bi bi-search"></i>
  </button>`
  **not great, here i got an error**

> **what was going on**

- I needed to write function to set **count** in the parent element <App/> and then pass down **this function** as a **props**. It has to be like:
- 1. in **<App/>** writing :
  - `
const handleCount= (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  setCount(count + 1)
}`
- 2. passings **props**
  - `<SearchBar
  handleCount={handleCount}
/>`
- 3. implementing props in the onClick Event
  - `<button
    className="btn_wrapper d-flex flex-center"
    onClick={handleCount}
    > <i className="bi bi-search"></i> > </button>`

> After correctly implement these step the error **cannot update a component while rendering another component** was fixed.
>
> **3. creating slider in the x-axis**
> I really thanks **kevin Powell** on **Youtube** with his bunch of **tutorial** helping **people** to better understand how **css** work. The tutorial about **create a horizontal media scroller with css** help me figure out how to **use** `Grid css` to shift content from the **Y-axis** to the **X-axis** by doing some simply change :

1. inside the container **div**:
   - display: **grid**
   - grid-auto-flow: **column**
   - grid-auto-columns: **100%** //for me
   - overflow-x: **auto**

- and **so on...**

## CSS Structures:

# What I learned

### Use Bootstrap Classes in React

All we need to do is to install bootstrap and import **minified version** of css and js in the **indexjs** file of our project.
After that we can use and learn about classes of bootstrap in the source website : [https://getbootstrap.com](https://getbootstrap.com)
Like this:

- command(inside our directory project) : npm install bootstrap
- add :
  - import "bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css";
  - import "bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min";
- Use Classes you need searching over the bunch of classes given in the official website _getbootstrap.com_

### Achieve Carousel slider in React

- we need to install the module `react-responsive-carousel` via **npm** `npm install react-responsive-carousel` or **yarn** `yarn add react-responsive-carousel`
- we will be also import `<Carousel><Carousel/>` in the right component where we implement it .
- also import some **minified css** style for \*\*Carousel :
  - `import { Carousel } from "react-responsive-carousel";
    import "react-responsive-carousel/lib/styles/carousel.min.css";
`
- and straightly implement it . See under my <MeaningsBox.jsx> file how it was done.

### to carefully use `useState Hook` in parent and children components.

### utilities Materials:

    -bootstrap and bootstrap icons

### Mobile Responsiveness

    - Mobile reponsiveness for mobile min-width: 210px

## Callback History:

- Youtube was founded by **Steve Chen**, **Chad Hurley**, **Jazed Karim** respectively graduated **Computer science** for the both former and **design** for the later. The trio were ex-employee of **PayPal**.
- The Original idea said **Hurley and Chen** a **video version** of an **online dating service** heavily influenced by the website **Hot or Not**
- Still other languages die out due to political oppression or social assimilaion, though many dying languages **live on** in the vocabularies and dialects of prominent languages around the world.

\__Jawed Karim said_
inspiration for Youtube first came from the **SuperBowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy**, when Janet Jackson;s breast was briefly exposed by Justin Timberlake during the haltime Show. He couldn't easily find the videos clips.
